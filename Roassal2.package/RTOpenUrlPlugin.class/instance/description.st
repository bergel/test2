'When you open a visualization, you can export it by clicking on the "..." icon. 
One of the available exporter is HTML. Without this plugin, if you exporter your 
visualization as HTML _does not_ open the page within the web browser (you need 
to do it automatically). After having loaded this plugin, the web browser will 
automatically open the exporter HTML file.'
